# Instructions

- You only need to submit the .Rmd of this file, not a PDF.

- You should __comment__ your code clearly to show what you've done to prepare the data.

- The purpose of this file is to use the data in the `data-raw` folder to create the data you will use in the report. The data you will use in the report should be saved in the `data` folder. It is good professional practice to make sure you're never directly modifying your raw data, but instead creating new datasets based on merges/manipulations that you need to reuse.

- Make sure you've taken a look at the hints for the web scraping and census API. 

- You may find the `write_rds()` function from the `readr` package helpful (it is loaded as part of the `tidyverse`).

- You do not need to keep the structure below.

# Set up

```{r, libraries}
# Set up any libraries you need
library(tidyverse)
library(cancensus)
library(sf)
library(geojsonsf)
library(haven)
library(polite)
library(rvest)
```

# Loading client data

```{r}

# Postal code data

# Note that using the original dataset crashes on JupyterHub so we will be using break_glass_in_case_of_emergency instead. C

# Code for had we used the original dataset:
# dataset = read_sav("data-raw/pccfNat_fccpNat_082021sav.sav")
# postcode <- dataset %>% 
#   select(PC, CSDuid)

# Using break_glass_in_case_of_emergency instead
postal_code <- read_rds("data-raw/break_glass_in_case_of_emergency.Rds")

# Customer to device data
cust_dev <- read_rds("data-raw/cust_dev.Rds")

# Device data
device <- read_rds("data-raw/device.Rds")

# Customer data
customer <- read_rds("data-raw/customer.Rds")

# Customer sleep data
cust_sleep <- readRDS("data-raw/cust_sleep.Rds")
```

# Getting external data

## Web scraping industry data

```{r}
# Device
url <- "https://fitnesstrackerinfohub.netlify.app/"

# Make sure this code is updated appropriately to provide 
# informative user_agent details
target <- bow(url,
              user_agent = "cindyy.huang@utoronto.ca for STA303/1002 project",
              force = TRUE)

# Any details provided in the robots text on crawl delays and 
# which agents are allowed to scrape
target

html <- scrape(target)

device_data <- html %>% 
  html_elements("table") %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  pluck(1) # added, in case you're getting a list format
```


# Census API

```{r}

# Retrieving income data from the 2016 Canada census

        cancensus.cache_path = "cache") # this sets a folder for your cache


# get all regions as at the 2016 Census (2020 not up yet)
regions <- list_census_regions(dataset = "CA16")

regions_filtered <-  regions %>% 
  filter(level == "CSD") %>% # Figure out what CSD means in Census data
  as_census_region_list()

# This can take a while
# We want to get household median income
census_data_csd <- get_census(dataset='CA16', regions = regions_filtered,
                          vectors=c("v_CA16_2397"), 
                          level='CSD', geo_format = "sf")

# Simplify to only needed variables

## Data Wrangling
```{r}

# Customers with more than 1 postcode and hence, more than 1 income will now be assigned the mean of those incomes
