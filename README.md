# STA303 Final Project

This is the joint effort of Chloe Nguyen, Shih-Ting (Cindy) Huang, Warren Zhu, and Xiaotang (Jeffrey) Zhou for the final project of "STA303: Methods of Data Analysis" at the University of Toronto. Students received data as well as web scraping, accessing an API and retrieving licensed data, and then used these to merge, wrangle, visualize, summarize and model data on fitness tracker customers to meet a client brief, and reported on their methods and findings appropriately for a general executive audience and, separately, for a technical audience.
